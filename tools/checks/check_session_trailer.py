"""check_session_trailer.py -- the mechanical check for
practices/session-trailer.md.

# practice: session-trailer

Scope: tree, judged on what a push would carry. Every non-merge commit
reachable from HEAD that origin does not have yet must carry a session
trailer line -- `Session: <url>`, `Claude-Session: <url>`
(the trailer key Claude Code Remote's own harness actually emits as of
2026-09; functionally the same trailer the practice's Rule describes,
under a different key), or the explicit `Session: none available (<tool>)`
opt-out. A commit with none of these is the "forgotten" case the
practice's own Why section exists to make distinguishable from "considered
and skipped."

Merge commits are excluded: a merge doesn't represent new planned work of
its own (the substantive commits underneath it already carry their own
trailers), and GitHub's own merge-via-API/UI commits never carry a custom
trailer at all -- checking them would fail on every single PR merge,
forever, for a reason that has nothing to do with this practice's actual
intent ("committing anything" in the occasion sense means authoring a
change, not the structural act of merging one).

WHICH COMMITS (2026-09-29, Morgan, strength: decided). This walked every
commit reachable from HEAD, so a commit that reached main before this check
ran anywhere failed every later full sweep -- a consumer's Promote refused
over one such commit already on main, which nothing a session could do
would fix without rewriting published history. It now judges only what is
not on origin yet (`HEAD --not --remotes=origin`): each commit is judged at
the first push that carries it -- Booked into pre-staging included -- the
same way the author and date checks judge only what a push brings. Nothing
already on origin needs grandfathering. `--range A..B` (or the
PRECEDENT_CHECK_RANGE environment variable) judges exactly that range, and
`--all-history` restores the whole walk for a deliberate audit.

Two kinds of commit are exempt besides merges:
  - one GitHub made with its own buttons (committer `noreply@github.com`:
    a merge, squash or revert button, a web edit) -- no session wrote it,
    and there is nowhere to add a trailer;
  - a revert (`Revert "..."` / `This reverts commit <sha>.`), but only where
    the working-style set's `revert-needs-no-trailer` practice is in force.
    A repository that does not declare it still requires the trailer.

Exit 0 and print nothing when clean. Exit 1 and print the practice's own
Rule text (never a paraphrase) plus the specific finding(s) on a violation.
Exit 2 -- SKIPPED, the NotApplicable convention -- when the history this
scope needs is not all here to be walked. See truncated_history().

# runs the script in place against itself. Precedent's own repo is exactly
# that: its practices/ is the universal catalogue, so `parents[2]/practices/`
# resolved to a directory this practice was never in, and rule_text() raised
# FileNotFoundError from inside the violation printer (2026-09-06). The rule
# text always ships beside the script, so it is looked up against SOURCE_ROOT

# precedent_materialize.py overwrites on every sync.
#
# check_commit_author.py and check_buenos_aires_dates.py closed exactly this
# gap for themselves on 2026-09-07 and 2026-09-10. This check did not, and
# nothing recorded that the three had diverged -- so a consumer could exempt
# a pre-hook commit from two of the three sibling checks and was simply stuck
# with the third. Found 2026-09-14 in a consumer with 21 commits predating

    `Scope: tree` claims to audit, or "" when it does.

    WHY A CLEAN RUN WAS NOT EVIDENCE (2026-09-10). find_violations() walks
    `git log` and reports what it finds. On a SHALLOW clone the walk simply
    stops at the graft boundary, finds nothing beyond it, and the check
    exits 0 -- reporting "every non-merge commit reachable from HEAD carries
    a trailer" when what actually happened is that most commits were never
    looked at. "Nothing to report" and "could not look" produced the same
    green, which is the failure this function exists to separate.

    Measured in this repo, on the clone this session started from:
    `git log` saw 101 commits and the check said clean; after
    `git fetch --depth=1000 origin main` it saw 114. Thirteen commits had
    been out of reach, and nothing said so. None of the thirteen turned out
    to violate -- which is luck, and exactly why it is worth a guard: the
    green looked identical either way.

    Note that this is NOT the same hazard `_is_merge` documents below.
    That one is about how git PRETTY-PRINTS a commit at the boundary; this
    one is about which commits the traversal reaches at all. Both come from
