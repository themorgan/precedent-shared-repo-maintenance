"""precedent_show.py — the one code path every loading channel calls
(PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "Loading a Practice Means Loading Its Rule, Not
Its File"). An agent never reads a practices/*.md file directly: it calls
this, and only this command's output enters context. That is what makes the
Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split actually save tokens — reading the file directly would
front-load the whole thing, Story included, defeating the split.

Multiple slugs concatenate, each under its own "### slug" heading, so a
caller loading several practices for one occasion gets one block back.

Exit 1, with a clear message naming the missing slug, on any slug that
doesn't resolve to a practices/*.md file -- this is a degrade-gracefully
tool (personal pack fail-gracefully, generalized): a bad slug in an occasion
index entry should be loud, not a silent empty read.
