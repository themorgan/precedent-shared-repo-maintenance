"""precedent_vendor_engine.py — vendors Precedent's engine into a repo that
consumes it, as real tracked files instead of an undocumented hand-copy.
Two KINDS, sharing one mechanism:

  'source'   — an individual or team practice SET (precedent-individual,
               precedent-team-maintainers, precedent-team-tms). Needs only
               ENGINE_FILES: enough to run its own AGENTS.md loader block
               (precedent_show.py's Rule/Detail/Why/Story/Install split,
               build_views.py's `--agents-only` regeneration,
               precedent_paths.py's path-trigger channel, precedent_gate.py's
               closed gate vocabulary). This is the original, narrower case
               this tool closed first — see spec/BOOTSTRAP_NEW_SOURCES.md.

  'consumer' — a real four-source CONSUMER repo (universal + team +
               individual + repo-local, a vendored process/upstream/, the
               full precedent_materialize.py/precedent_resolve.py/
               precedent_sync_views.py toolchain that resolves all of them
               into one materialized tree). Needs CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES:
               everything 'source' needs, PLUS those three multi-source
               tools — see TODO.md item 18 and this repo's own
               engine-plus-host-shims practice ("domain-neutral mechanism
               lives in the vendored tree"). Piloted 2026-09-05 against
               themorgan/HavrutaBrainstorm — INSTALL.md §1 step 12 and §2
               step 6 document the consumer-repo procedure this closes.

THE GAP 'source' CLOSED FIRST. tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py has only
ever written practice content, config, approvers and the leak-blocklist —
never an engine file. Every individual/team set that existed before this
tool got its tools/build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py,
precedent_show.py and split_practices.py into place by an undocumented,
one-off hand-copy, so none of them could tell a stale copy from a current
one, and precedent-team-tms's copy was simply missing outright.

THE GAP 'consumer' CLOSES. A real consumer's own tools/ needing the same
treatment was named explicitly as future work when 'source' shipped
(TODO.md item 18: "not piloted... deliberately not folded into the
source-repo fix"). themorgan/HavrutaBrainstorm — a real four-source
consumer, not a fixture — had the identical undocumented-hand-copy problem
'source' closed for practice sets: its top-level tools/ held
build_views.py, precedent_gate.py, precedent_paths.py, precedent_show.py,
split_practices.py, precedent_materialize.py, precedent_resolve.py and
precedent_sync_views.py, all copied in by hand at some point in the past
with no manifest, no recorded source commit, and (confirmed 2026-09-05) six
of those eight files had already drifted from BestPractice's current
tools/ — including the --repo-awareness fix (commit 7c8d33d) and the
repo-local `path: "."` safety fix (commit 29148bc's sibling changes to
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_materialize.py), silently missing from the
consumer's copy the whole time.

Distinct from tools/checkin.py, which mirrors a CONSUMER's whole
process/upstream/ tree, deleting anything the tree no longer has, in BOTH
directions (a consumer pulls upstream content AND pushes its own
check-ins back). This engine is one-directional in both kinds —
downstream from BestPractice only, since neither a source set nor a
consumer's own tools/ has engine code of its own to contribute back — and
it sits inside tools/ ALONGSIDE non-vendored, repo-owned files (tools/checks/,
routing_scope.json is vendored but trimmed, a source set's own
build_codeowners.py, a consumer's own bootstrap.sh/light_check.py/
report_automation_issue.py) that a whole-directory mirror-and-delete would
destroy. So this is a NEW, narrower tool, not an extension of checkin.py:
it touches only the files it knows about, by name, per kind.

ENGINE_FILES / CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES both name this script itself last, on
purpose: it travels WITH the engine it defines, so a future improvement to
the vendoring mechanism itself reaches every already-vendored repo the same
way an improvement to build_views.py does — not a second, undocumented gap
one layer up from the one this tool closes. precedent_materialize.py/
precedent_resolve.py/precedent_sync_views.py are never in ENGINE_FILES
(source) — a source set has no process/upstream/ and nothing to resolve
against more than one tree — but they ARE in CONSUMER_ENGINE_FILES
(consumer), where resolving four sources into one materialized tree is the
entire point.

routing_scope.json is vendored in both kinds too, but it is not a
byte-identical copy: precedent_gate.py's SCOPE file carries two things in
this repo — the closed GATE vocabulary (`gates`, the moments a practice can
fire at, which is the same everywhere Precedent's loader runs, regardless
of kind) and a `practices` key documenting the routing reason for every one
of BestPractice's OWN 60-odd practices, which has no meaning in either a
source set or a consumer repo with a different catalogue entirely.
`_trim_routing_scope` below keeps only the first and drops the second — the
same trim a prior, undocumented hand-copy already applied by hand to every
repo that needed it (precedent-individual, precedent-team-maintainers, and
HavrutaBrainstorm's own top-level tools/routing_scope.json, all three
confirmed byte-identical to this function's output before this tool
existed, or was extended to the consumer kind); this tool just makes that
trim mechanical instead of a fact only the session that did it once
remembered.

Four subcommands:

  seed <dest-dir> [--kind source|consumer]
                                  Run from BESTPRACTICE'S OWN checkout (the
                                  case tools/precedent_bootstrap_source.py
                                  needs — no clone required, the source IS
                                  this checkout). --kind defaults to
                                  'source' (unchanged CLI/API for every
                                  existing caller — precedent_bootstrap_
                                  source.py calls seed(dest) with no kind
                                  argument at all, and gets the same
                                  narrower set it always has). Copies the
                                  kind's file list and a trimmed
                                  routing_scope.json into <dest-dir>/tools/,
                                  and writes
                                  <dest-dir>/tools/ENGINE_MANIFEST.json
                                  recording this checkout's HEAD commit,
                                  the kind, and a sha256 per vendored file.

  status <bestpractice-clone>    Run from an ALREADY-VENDORED repo of
                                  either kind (same shape checkin.py's
                                  verbs use): reads `kind` back out of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json (no --kind flag
                                  needed — the manifest already says which
                                  file list applies) and compares the
                                  vendored files against its recorded
                                  hashes (local hand-edit?) and against the
                                  clone's current tools/ (upstream moved?).
                                  Exit 1 if either differs.

  refresh <bestpractice-clone> [--force] [--from-ref REF]
                                  Same kind auto-detection as status. Pulls
                                  the clone's SOURCE_BRANCH (see below —
                                  NOT the clone's configured default
                                  branch), refuses if a vendored file was
                                  hand-edited since the last seed/refresh
                                  (its sha256 no longer matches
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json) unless --force, then
                                  re-copies + re-trims (the kind's own file
                                  list) and updates the manifest.

  fresh                          Clone-free staleness notice, no argument
                                  needed: one `git ls-remote` of
                                  ENGINE_MANIFEST.json's recorded repo,
                                  compared to the recorded commit. Always
                                  exits 0 (a notice, never a gate); silent
                                  on network failure vs. loud on a fast,
                                  clean failure (checkin.py's fresh() carries
                                  the same distinction and the same reason:
                                  an unreachable remote must never read as
                                  "confirmed fresh").

Run (from an already-vendored repo's own checkout, either kind):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py fresh
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py status  ../BestPractice
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py refresh ../BestPractice

Run once, from BestPractice's own checkout, to vendor a NEW consumer repo
(status/refresh above then work unchanged, kind auto-detected):
  python3 tools/precedent_vendor_engine.py seed <consumer-repo> --kind consumer

SOURCE_BRANCH is 'precedent-beta-v01', not BestPractice's configured
default branch ('main') — see local/practices/merge-target-is-beta-branch.md:
until Alex's deliberate phase-7 fold-in, routine engine work lands on
precedent-beta-v01, and 'main' is stale for this purpose. That practice's
own retirement clause applies here too: the moment the fold-in happens,
change SOURCE_BRANCH to 'main' in this one place, in the same PR.

    `refresh` updates the ENGINE and nothing else, by design -- taking the

    because installs are adapted and an unattended mirror is the mechanism
    class that loses content. The cost of that separation is a skew nobody
    was told about: engine code that cites a practice slug the vendored
    catalogue predates.

    THE REMEDY THIS NOTICE NAMES IS DELIBERATELY NOT `checkin.py update`.
    Its first version suggested exactly that, and the suggestion was worse
    than silence: checkin.py's `_default_branch()` resolves
    `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` unconditionally, so on every consumer pinned
    to `precedent-beta-v01` -- which is all of them, until the phase-7
    fold-in -- following the advice mirrors `main` over the vendored tree
    and DELETES the very practices this notice says are missing. Caught
    2026-09-06 by the consumer session that read the notice, recognized the
    trap, and did the manual mirror instead; spec/MIGRATING_EXISTING_INSTALLS.md's
    "The default-branch gotcha" is the same finding from the other side.
    Teaching checkin.py the pin is the real fix and a larger change; until
    then this notice must not send anyone at it.

    Reached a real consumer on 2026-09-06. A refresh took the engine to a
    commit whose `precedent_resolve.py` cites `source-naming` three times,
    while `process/upstream/` still sat 5 commits back and had no
    `practices/source-naming.md` -- so the repo's own `code-cites-practice`
    check reported three violations for a slug that does exist upstream, in
    code the consumer is not allowed to edit. Nothing in the refresh had
    said the two halves were now different ages.

    Reports, never fails: the skew is legitimate between an engine refresh
    and the catalogue update that follows it, and this runs at the moment
    the person is right there to act on it. Practice fail-gracefully: keep
    going, and tell the human.
