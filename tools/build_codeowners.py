"""build_codeowners.py -- generate CODEOWNERS from approvers.json.

PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md, "Who the Approvers Are, and How They Get That Job":
"Approvers are declared in the practice set's own config, not in a
host-specific file... GitHub's CODEOWNERS is then generated from that list,
the same way every other view in this system is generated, so there is one
source and the platform enforcement derives from it rather than competing
with it."

approvers.json is that config; CODEOWNERS is the generated GitHub-specific
view. Never hand-edit CODEOWNERS -- edit approvers.json and rerun this
script. The generated file carries a derived-file header naming its source,
its recipe and the command that rebuilds it, since it is exactly the case
that calls for one: a file a later regeneration overwrites wholesale.

WHY THIS IS PART OF THE VENDORED SOURCE-SET ENGINE. It was written inside
one team set and lived only there, which meant the plan's own approval
mechanism -- "approvers are declared in the set's own config, and
CODEOWNERS is generated from that list" -- had exactly one implementation,
in a private repo, reachable by nobody else. A second team set
(bootstrapped 2026-09-05 from templates/practice-set-team/) got its
approvers.json and no way to turn it into enforcement: approvers declared,
approvals unenforced, and nothing saying so. Promoted here 2026-09-06 so
every team set the bootstrap tool creates has it from the first commit
(practice: affordance-is-shared).

An individual set has no approvers.json and needs none -- one person is
the whole approval mechanism -- so this exits 0 with a note there rather
than failing.
