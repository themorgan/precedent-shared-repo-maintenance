"""build_views.py — phase-2 generated views (PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md,
Sequence row 2: "make AGENTS.md, MAP.md, GLOSSARY.md and the index
generated"). Regenerates:

  - the loader block inside AGENTS.md, between the
    <!-- BEGIN GENERATED: precedent-loader --> / <!-- END GENERATED -->
    markers: the resident block (## Rule of every tier: resident practice),
    the occasion index (on-demand practices grouped by occasion), and the
    standing instruction. This is "the one generated file containing
    exactly three things" from "How an Agent Knows Which Practices to
    Load" -- AGENTS.md carries it because AGENTS.md is what a session
    already loads at start, rather than inventing a second file sessions
    would need to be told to also read.
  - MAP.md, in full (a generated file, not hand-authored).
  - GLOSSARY.md, in full, built from every practice's `defines:` field.

Hand-editing any of these three fails the check: rerun this script and diff
against the committed tree; any difference is a check failure (wired into
tools/verify_harness.py).

The resident block has a hard token ceiling (see RESIDENT_BUDGET_TOKENS
below, and PRACTICE_ENGINE_PLAN.md's "The Resident Budget" -- "target ~2,000
tokens, hard-capped"). Token count is approximated as words * 1.3 (no
tokenizer dependency; see (practice: computed-numbers-in-scripts), computed
numbers live in scripts -- this IS that script, not a number restated by
hand elsewhere). Exceeding the
cap fails the build outright: adding a resident practice must cost demoting
or retiring another, mechanically, not by discipline.
